Run preProc_and_feature_analysis to pre processes and perform feature analysis. Follow instructions for passing in path to folder that contains raw data and path for location where processed dfs are stored.
Next, follow instructions in preProc detailing sections to uncomment before NN training, call preprocess functions on dfs again, in either program, then run NN.py to train and save model insights. Verify file paths used in the training loop.
RL.py can be run directly as processing is handled within, ensuring to update file paths to your processed datasets.
